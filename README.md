# Ideal Customer Profile Insights

Developed an interactive dashboard in Power BI focused on customer personality analysis using the Four Pâ€™s marketing strategy (Product, Price, Place, Promotion). The project involved importing and transforming a customer dataset to derive insights on demographics and purchasing behaviors. Key visualizations included average income by education and marital status, customer distribution by year of birth, and product purchase preferences. Utilized donut and pie charts to illustrate customer segments based on education, complaints, and purchase locations, enabling better strategic marketing decisions. The dashboard enhanced understanding of customer profiles, facilitating data-driven modifications to products and marketing approaches.
